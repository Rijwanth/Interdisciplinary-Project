Russell Ohl faced several challenges in his work on solar cells:<br>
1.	Scientific Understanding:<br>
•	Ohl's work was built on the understanding of semiconductors and the p-n junction. This required a deep understanding of the principles of solid-state physics, which was an emerging field during his time.<br>
2.	Technology Limitations:<br>
•	The technology available during the 1930s was not as advanced as today. Fabricating and testing semiconductor materials for solar cell applications involved considerable technical challenges.<br>
3.	Recognition and Acceptance:<br>
•	Initially, Ohl's work on semiconductors and the development of the p-n junction was not immediately recognized for its potential in generating electricity from sunlight. It took time for the scientific community to appreciate the significance of his discoveries.<br>
4.	Wartime Constraints:<br>
•	The period during which Ohl was actively researching solar cells coincided with World War II. The war effort redirected resources and attention, which could have impacted the pace of advancements in solar cell technology.<br>
Contribution:<br>
Russell Ohl's most notable contribution was the discovery of the p-n junction, a crucial element in the development of the modern solar cell. In 1941, he discovered that when a semiconductor material (silicon) was exposed to light, it generated an electric current. This laid the foundation for the practical application of solar cells to convert sunlight into electricity.
While he may be considered the "Father of Solar Cells" for his pioneering work, it's essential to acknowledge that the field of solar energy has seen contributions from numerous researchers and scientists over the years, each building upon the work of those who came before them.<br><img src="C:\Users\RIJWANTH.R\Documents\il0vecricket07\Russel Ohl.jpg"><br><br>
